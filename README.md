# React User Registration with Formik, Redux Toolkit, and WordPress Custom Endpoint

This project demonstrates how to create a user registration flow in a React application, integrating Formik for form handling, Redux Toolkit for state management, and a custom endpoint in WordPress for user registration. Follow along to set up the necessary components, state management, and backend integration for a seamless registration experience.

## Features

1. **Creating the Register Component**
   - Structure React components.
   - Set up necessary files and folders.
   - Understand the key differences between `.js` and `.jsx` files and when to use each.

2. **Using Formik for Form Handling**
   - Set up the Register form with Formik.
   - Handle form submission and client-side validation using Formik's API.

3. **Setting Up Redux Toolkit**
   - Create the Register slice for state management.
   - Implement actions and reducers to manage user registration-related state changes.

4. **Creating a Custom Endpoint in WordPress**
   - Define custom routes and handle HTTP requests.
   - Securely store user registration data in the WordPress database.

5. **Integration and Final Result**
   - Integrate React application, Register component, Redux state management, and WordPress custom endpoint.
   - Demonstrate the entire user registration flow from form submission to data storage.
